course_name: Intorduction to Computer Vision
course_description: "Computer vision is one of the major research fields of artificial intelligence, with many applications in image understanding and processing, medical care, autonomous driving, and robotics. We offer this undergraduate course to provide a comprehensive introduction to the basic concepts of computer vision and its broad applications. In this course, we will cover both the traditional non-learning methods (e.g. classic descriptors, multiview geometry) and deep learning based methods from a modern perspective, where 3D vision serves as a natural bridge.The objective of this course is thus to consolidate the fundemantals, depict a full picture of this field, and get the students prepared for doing frontier research in computer vision. During this course, students will learn to build a basic vision system and implement and train their own neural networks to process and analyze 2D and 3D visual data."
